// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analOfReqs = 'This is the second step, in which requirements are laid out for creating the program in question, and the feasibility of the project is determined. If approved, the project progresses to the 3rd step.'
const design = 'The 3rd step, in which software specifications are turned into a plan and others offer feedback as they review the plan.'
const implement = '4th step. The approved design is coded.'
const test = '5th step. The written code is tested for defects and bugs. Oftentimes, a defect will send the project back to implementing since code is being rewritten until approved anf functional. The approved code will be published.'
const maintain = 'Bugs and problems are bound to happen, even after extensive testing. Maintenance is necessary to keep the program functioning.'
